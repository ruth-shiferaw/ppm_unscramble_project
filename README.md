# ppm_unscramble_project
This is a project I worked on (with another CS student to shorten the time frame) to implement a program to perform operations on a 15 Puzzle (a puzzle with a square grid of tiles with one tile missing). The tiles can be moved around by sliding the “gap” tile. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that each one is in the correct position.
